# Obsidian Plugin: Granola Meetings Simple Sync

Sync your [Granola](https://granola.ai) meeting notes to Obsidian.

This plugin uses [Granola's official MCP API](https://docs.granola.ai/help-center/sharing/integrations/mcp) to sync meeting notes, AI summaries, and transcripts into your vault. One-time OAuth setup, then fully automatic.

## Features

- **Official API**: Uses Granola's MCP API with OAuth authentication
- **Multiple accounts**: Connect more than one Granola account and sync them all into the same vault
- **Auto-sync**: Automatically sync meetings at configurable intervals (1m to 12h)
- **Standalone Transcripts**: Decouples full transcripts into separate documents (`type: transcript`) bidirectionally linked with meeting notes (`type: meeting`), keeping notes lightweight and preventing transcript API calls from blocking note creation
- **Live Progress & Interruption**: Real-time sync progress with item counts, transcript pacing countdown, status bar indicator, and a "Stop sync" button
- **Custom Path Routing**: Route notes and transcripts using `{granolaFolder}`, `{meeting_date}`, `{meeting_name}`, and `{id}`. Transcripts can be saved side-by-side or in custom subfolders
- **Rate Limit Protection**: Built-in 65-second spacing between transcript downloads with reactive exponential backoff on HTTP 429
- **Template-based**: Customize output format with separate templates for meeting notes and transcripts
- **Smart deduplication**: Tracks meetings by ID to avoid duplicates
- **Preserve edits**: Option to skip existing notes so your local changes aren't overwritten
- **Attendee linking**: Automatically link attendees to existing notes by email

There are other ([1](https://github.com/dannymcc/Granola-to-Obsidian), [2](https://github.com/tomelliot/obsidian-granola-sync)) Granola plugins for Obsidian, but I found their implementation lacking for my needs. They either had unnecessary complexity or didn't support features like bringing in private notes, linking to attendee Person notes, or customizing the note template/frontmatter. This plugin fits my workflow better.

## Installation

### Install from the Obsidian Directory (recommended)

Click "Add to Obsidian" from https://community.obsidian.md/plugins/granola-meetings-simple-sync

### Install via BRAT
1. Install the [BRAT plugin](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) from Obsidian's community plugins
2. In BRAT settings, click **Add Beta plugin**
3. Enter `philfreo/obsidian-granola-plugin`
4. Enable the plugin in Settings → Community plugins

BRAT will automatically keep the plugin updated.

### Manual Installation
1. Create a folder `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/granola-meetings-simple-sync/`
2. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the [latest release](https://github.com/philfreo/obsidian-granola-plugin/releases) into that folder
3. Reload Obsidian, then enable the plugin in Settings → Community plugins

## Setup

1. Open plugin settings
2. Click **Connect to Granola** — this opens your browser for OAuth authentication
3. Authorize the plugin in your browser
4. You'll be redirected back to Obsidian automatically
5. Meetings will start syncing!

To sync more than one Granola account, click **Add Granola account** in settings and repeat the OAuth flow. All connected accounts sync into the same folder, deduplicated by meeting ID.

## Settings

![Settings screenshot](docs/options-screenshot.png)

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Time range | Last 30 days | How far back to look for meetings. Options: This week, Last week, Last 30 days, Last 90 days, Last 180 days, Last 1 year, All time. (Note: Granola Free plans restrict history to 30 days) |
| Sync frequency | Every 15 minutes | How often to sync. Options: Manual only, On startup, 1m, 15m, 30m, 60m, 12h |
| Only my meetings | On | Sync only meetings you recorded or were listed as a participant in, including notes shared with you. Turn off to also sync every workspace-visible meeting |
| Sync transcripts | Off | Download full transcripts as standalone documents. Transcripts are fetched in Phase 2 with a 65s pacing delay between calls to comply with Granola rate limits |
| Folder path | `Meetings` | Where to save meeting notes. Supports `{granolaFolder}` / `{folder}`, `{meeting_date}` / `{date}`, `{meeting_name}` / `{title}`, `{id}` |
| Filename pattern | `{date} {title}` | Pattern for meeting note filenames. Supports `{date}`, `{date:YYYY-MM-DD}`, `{title}`, `{id}`, `{granolaFolder}` |
| Template path | `Templates/Granola.md` | Path to your meeting note template file |
| Transcript folder | `{meeting_folder}` | Where to save transcript documents. Defaults to the same folder as the meeting note. Supports `{meeting_folder}`, `{meeting_filename}`, `{granolaFolder}`, `{date}`, `{title}`, `{id}` |
| Transcript filename pattern | `{filename} (Transcript)` | Pattern for transcript filenames. Supports `{meeting_filename}` / `{filename}`, `{meeting_folder}`, `{date}`, `{title}`, `{id}`, `{granolaFolder}` |
| Transcript template path | `Templates/Granola Transcript.md` | Path to your transcript document template file |
| Show ribbon icon | On | Show a sync button in the left sidebar |
| Skip existing notes | On | Don't overwrite notes you've edited. Existing notes are matched by `granola_id` anywhere in your vault, not just the sync folder, so notes you've moved aren't duplicated |
| Exclude yourself from attendees | On | Leave your own Granola account out of the attendee list |
| Match attendees by email | On | Link attendees to notes with matching email in frontmatter |

## Usage & Live Progress

1. **Triggering a sync**: By default your meetings sync automatically at your chosen frequency. You can also manually trigger a sync by clicking the ribbon icon, running the "Sync meetings" command from the palette, or clicking "Sync now" in plugin settings.
2. **Real-time Progress & Status Bar**: During a sync, the settings page displays an active progress bar with step-by-step status messages (e.g. `Syncing meetings (3/15)...`, `Next transcript in 42s (2/5)...`). The Obsidian status bar also displays live sync counts and countdowns.
3. **Interrupting a Sync**: If you need to stop a long-running sync (such as when downloading many transcripts), click the **Stop sync** button in settings. The plugin gracefully aborts network requests and stops the pacing loop immediately.

## Template Variables & Decoupled Architecture

Transcripts are stored in separate documents rather than embedded into the meeting notes. This ensures that meeting notes are generated quickly in Phase 1, while transcript downloads proceed in Phase 2 without blocking note generation or causing file bloat. The two documents are bidirectionally linked via frontmatter properties.

### Available Variables

#### Core & Folder Variables
- `{{granola_id}}` - Unique meeting ID
- `{{granola_title}}` - Meeting title
- `{{granola_date}}` - Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `{{granola_folder}}` - Granola folder name
- `{{granola_url}}` - Link to meeting on Granola web
- `{{granola_start_time}}` - Start time (e.g., "3:00 PM")

#### Bidirectional Linking Variables
- `{{granola_meeting_transcript}}` - The filename/title of the linked transcript document (for use in meeting note templates)
- `{{granola_meeting_note}}` - The filename/title of the linked meeting note (for use in transcript templates)

#### Content Variables
- `{{granola_private_notes}}` - Your notes from the meeting
- `{{granola_enhanced_notes}}` - AI-generated content (Summary, Action Items, etc.)
- `{{granola_transcript}}` - Full transcript text (for transcript templates)

#### Attendees
- `{{granola_attendees}}` - Comma-separated names
- `{{granola_attendees_linked}}` - With Obsidian links: `[[John]], [[Jane]]`
- `{{granola_attendees_list}}` - YAML list format
- `{{granola_attendees_linked_list}}` - YAML list with links

### Conditional Blocks

Use `{{#variable}}...{{/variable}}` to render content only when a variable is non-empty.

## Requirements

- **Desktop only**: This plugin requires Node.js APIs available only in Obsidian's desktop app
- **Granola account**: You'll be prompted to authenticate via OAuth on first use

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # Build (watch mode)
npm run build      # Build (production)
npm run lint       # ESLint
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
npm test           # Run unit tests (Vitest) once
npm run test:watch # Run unit tests in watch mode
npm run package    # Build + copy main.js/manifest.json/versions.json into release/
```

### Testing in a real vault

Unit tests cover the parser and template logic, but to exercise the plugin inside Obsidian:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `OBSIDIAN_PLUGINS` to the `plugins` folder of the vault you want to test against, e.g.:
   ```
   OBSIDIAN_PLUGINS="$HOME/path/to/YourVault/.obsidian/plugins"
   ```
2. Run `npm run deploy-local`. This builds the plugin and copies it into `$OBSIDIAN_PLUGINS/granola-meetings-simple-sync/`, preserving any existing `data.json` (your settings/auth) so you don't have to reconnect each time.
3. In Obsidian, reload (or toggle the plugin off/on) to pick up the new build.

### Releasing

Releases are automated by `.github/workflows/release.yml`: pushing a tag of the form `X.Y.Z` builds the plugin and creates a GitHub release with `main.js` and `manifest.json` attached. BRAT and manual installs pull from that release.

To cut a release:

1. Bump the version: `npm version patch` (or `minor`/`major`). This runs `version-bump.mjs`, which updates `manifest.json` and `versions.json`, and stages them in the version commit.
2. Push the commit and the tag: `git push && git push --tags`.
3. The Release workflow runs on the tag and publishes the GitHub release.

Per [Obsidian's guidelines](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin), tags must **not** use a `v` prefix (use `1.0.0`, not `v1.0.0`) — `npm version` already creates tags without the prefix here, and the workflow only triggers on `[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+` tags.
